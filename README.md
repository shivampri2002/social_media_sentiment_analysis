# Social Media Sentiment Analysis

This project performs sentiment analysis on Twitter data using machine learning techniques. The goal of the project is to analyze public sentiment toward various topics by classifying tweets into three categories: positive, negative, and neutral. This is achieved through natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms.

## Project Overview
The **Social Media Sentiment Analysis** project collects and processes tweets, cleans and prepares the data, and then uses machine learning to classify the sentiment of each tweet. This can be useful for businesses, marketers, or social scientists to analyze public opinion on various issues, products, or services based on social media content.

### Key Objectives:
- Conduct data cleaning and preprocessing on raw Twitter data.
- Visualize the distribution of sentiments across tweets.
- Train a machine learning model to predict the sentiment of tweets (positive, negative, or neutral).

## Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Performed comprehensive cleaning using Pandas and NumPy to handle missing values, remove noise, and ensure high-quality input data.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualized tweet distributions and sentiment trends using Seaborn.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Used NLTK for tokenization, stopword removal, and sentiment classification.
- **Machine Learning**: Built and trained a sentiment classification model using Scikit-learn, capable of predicting the sentiment of a tweet with a high degree of accuracy.
  
## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Main programming language.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical data operations.
- **Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)**: For natural language processing, including tokenization and stopword removal.
- **Scikit-learn**: For developing and training the machine learning model.
  
## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/social-media-sentiment-analysis.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd social-media-sentiment-analysis
    ```

3. Install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Ensure you have collected the Twitter data you want to analyze, or use an available dataset.
2. Run the Python script to perform sentiment analysis on your dataset:
    ```bash
    python sentiment_analysis.py
    ```
3. The script will output visualizations, model accuracy, and the sentiment predictions of tweets.

### Example:
```bash
Input: "I love this new product!"
Output: Positive
```

## Model Performance
The machine learning model was trained using a labeled dataset of tweets and was able to achieve a high degree of accuracy in classifying sentiment into positive, negative, or neutral categories. The model evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, which can be viewed after training.
